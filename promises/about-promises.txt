A Promise is actually an object that represents an eventual result of an asynchronous action. 

A JavaScript Promise object has two internal properties: 

1. PromiseStatus

2. PromiseValue

A promise can be in 1 of 3 states - pending, fulfilled, and rejected. When a promise is in "pending" status,
the PromiseValue will be undefined. Fulfilled and rejected are fairly self-explanatory.
